Codes for machine learning algorithms, prescriptive modeling &amp; optimization projects, A/B test that I did:

# Machine Learning Algorithms
•Linear Regression: Ordinary Least Squares, Gerneralized Least Squares, Penalized Least Squares (LASSO, Ridge)
### [Telecom Work Measurement Study -OLS](Machine Learning/Telecom_Work_Measurement_Study.R)
This model is some telecom data and evaluates different linear regression models that determines the relationship between the dependent variable of number of hours worked, and some independent variables.
