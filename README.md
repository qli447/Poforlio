# Machine Learning Algorithms
•Linear Regression: Ordinary Least Squares, Gerneralized Least Squares, Penalized Least Squares (LASSO, Ridge)
### [Telecom Work Measurement Study -OLS](https://github.com/qli447/Poforlio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Telecom_Work_Measurement_Study.R)
This model is some telecom data and evaluates different linear regression models that determines the relationship between the dependent variable of number of hours worked, and some independent variables.

### [Claims_Study.R](https://github.com/qli447/Poforlio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/LASSO/Claims_Study.R)
This dataset includes insurance claims severities from Allstate. In this task, first we modify the dataset to show the claims which are higher than $100 and ran an OLS regression model. Next, we found the least mean-squared-error with LASSO model. Then, the best lambda was found with cross validation. 

### [LASSO Model](https://github.com/qli447/Poforlio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/LASSO/03.R)
The codes for LASSO Model

•Logistic  Regression
### [Caravan_Insurance_Study](https://github.com/qli447/Poforlio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression/Caravan_Insurance_Study.R)
I was given a dataset that indicates whether owners purchased caravan insurance or not in this database. This dataset also includes some demographic information about the owners. This study runs a logistic regression in order to see how these characteristics relate to the insurance buying decision of the caravan owners.

•Support Vector Machines(SVM)

•Classification Trees
### [Wine Data Study - Classification Tree Model](https://github.com/qli447/Poforlio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/SVM%20Classification%20Tree/Wine_Data_Classification.R)
This study looks at a Wine Data dataset that includes some features about the quality and characteristics of a variety of wines. The outcome variable is the quality of wines. This model aims to use a classification tree to find the most relevant set of features that can predict the wine quality the best.

•Random Forest, Graident Boosting and Neural Network
### [Wine Data Study - Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks](https://github.com/qli447/Poforlio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Neural%20Network/Wine_Data-trees_and_nnets.R)
In the previous study, we used classification ree to find the features that can prodict the wine quality best. And in this assignment we will set up a random forest model and then a gradient boosting model. Later on, we build up neural networks, compare single layer model and a model with hidden layers.

•Clustering
### [Wine Data Study - Clustering](https://github.com/qli447/Poforlio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Clustering%20PCA/Wine%20Data%20Study%20-%20Clustering.R)
We still use the same dataset of wine qualities, and in this study we run a clustering analysis to find out about any clusters in the set that might be useful for explaining data.

•PCA
